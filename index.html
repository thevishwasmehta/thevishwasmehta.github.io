              <p>In the previous projects we have calculated Nusselt number (Nu) by varying both the rotational Reynolds number and the jet Reynolds number of the flow by changing the various parameters such as nozzle to target spacing (z/d), the eccentricity of impingement (ϵ), angle of impingement, both towards and away from the center, and the pin fin height were varied and their effect on the corresponding finding were studied without changing the nozzle profile of the jet; hence, in this project, we will focus on varying the nozzle profile of the jet and observe the change in heat transfer over the target surface. This project provides the opportunity to study heat transfer enhancement features on a rotating surface where I am currently working on measuring the effect of extended surface on Jet Impingement heat transfer over a rotating disk. We are trying to compare the results obtained in ANSYS CFX to that of the experimental results.</p>

              <p>In this project, we designed a heat sink using triply-periodic minimal surface method which was generated in nTopology. The new design was able to accommodate 1.5 times the surface area (in the same volumetric constraint) to that of an already existing design of pin fin heat exchanger. ANSYS Discovery was used to simulate the heat transfer over TPMS generated Heat sink. It was later additively manufactured using Laser Powder bed fusion method and experiments were performed to correlate the simulation results with experimental observations.</p>

A camera taped the change in colour of liquid crystals over time. This video was imported into MATLAB and was separated into frames, which was used to develop a matrix of temperature using the hue value of every pixel as reference value. Ultimately, Duhamel’s superposition principle was used to calculate the local heat transfer coefficient of the surface.</p>

              <p>In this project, we developed a finite difference scheme to simulate the heat transfer on a 2 dimensional plane. The code was written in MATLAB. Three different boundary condition, i.e., heat flux, constant temperature, and adiabatic wall condition were used for this simulation. The results were compared for 2 different materials and 2 different grid resolution. The final solution was compared to ANSYS Steady state heat transfer model and was found to be at par to our FDM scheme solution.</p>

From the collected image and range for temperature we determine the heat transfer coefficient for every pixel and we also accommodate for the heat loss in the system. Finally, we use the gathered data of heat transfer coefficient to determine the Nusselt number for every pixel and use to generate a plot which mimics the Local Nu of three different Reynolds number for Circular and Swirl jet.</p>

              <p>In this project, we designed a buoy which acts as the terminal for communication for modern day submarine. We used FEMM to determine the current needed to keep the communications system running based on the tidal energy it stored. ANSYS CFD was used to analyse the self-supporting feature of the buoy. Since our model had a relative motion between the coils and the axel which was responsible for the generation for electricity, a coefficient of drag was associated with the design, and since it was to support itself on the surface of ocean water, a buoyant force was associated as well, ANSYS was used to visualize how the buoy will would work in similar condition.</p>

Three different information transfer models, i.e., Slow (bidirectional) axonal transport, 15% alpha syn monomer by fast axonal transport and only anterograde/ retrograde motor driven model were compared. Variables such as the concentration of information at the ends of the neuron, information transfer rate in the anterograde and retrograde direction, velocity of information carrier were varied and corresponding graphs were plotted on MATLAB.</p>
